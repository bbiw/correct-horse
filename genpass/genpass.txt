an automatic password formatter.

This program does not actually generate passwords, but formats a random password in a way that it is easier for humans to remember it.


genpass [-b bytes] [-s source] [-w wordlist] [-a alphabet] [hex|b32|b64|b95|word]*

read `bytes` bytes (default=16) from `source` (default=/dev/urandom)

print the read password in each format specified 
if none is specified, *all* will be used

`wordlist` is a file containing unique words separated by '\n'. 
Each word is considered a 'digit' in a base N representation of the password, where N is the number of words in the file.
`alphabet` is a set of unique characters

if -a or -w are specified, the default set of formats is not used.


hex alphabet: 0123456789abcdef
b32 alphabet: 0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstu
b64 alphabet: 0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUWXYz-.
b95 alphabet: ascii characters from 32 to 126 inclusive
word 'alphabet': an expanded "diceware" word list with 16384 words. 
	This allows a 128-bit password to be represented as 9 short words (3 groups of three)

note that the bN formats are not in general reversible, because they do not add padding characters
